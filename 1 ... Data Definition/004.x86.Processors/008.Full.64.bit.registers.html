    <!--
        This CSS is like a quick-reference guide for a pilot, clearly labeling
        each control in the cockpit. We're setting up a clean, light interface
        with calming blue tones to make the transition from 32-bit to 64-bit
        registers visually straightforward and easy to digest. It's about
        clarity and immediate recognition.

                    This is like upgrading a small delivery truck (EAX) to a full-sized semi-trailer (RAX).
                    It can carry much larger payloads (64-bit data) and is still the primary register

                    Think of it as upgrading a simple stopwatch (ECX) to a sophisticated digital timer (RCX).
                    It can count higher and is often used for passing the first function argument in 64-bit Windows.

                    It's like giving your data a bigger briefcase (EDX) that can now become a large suitcase (RDX).

                    It's like expanding a small bookmark (EBP) in a book to a full-sized, sturdy page marker (RBP).
                    It helps you navigate the current function's stack frame.

                    This is like upgrading your stack of plates from a small pile (ESP) to a towering, stable column (RSP).
                    It always points to the next available spot on the stack.

                    It's like upgrading a simple pointer (ESI) to a highly precise laser pointer (RSI)
                    that can point to any byte in a much larger data source.

                    This is the counterpart to RSI, like the target area for your laser pointer.
                    It's also used for passing the first function argument in 64-bit Linux/macOS.
