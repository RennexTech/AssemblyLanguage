Want to dive into how these files are structured internally (like .text, .data, and headers)?
Or shall we jump into number systems — binary, decimal, hex, signed vs unsigned — the stuff you’ll constantly juggle in ASM?

Your move, captain.

=================================

➡️ Want to move into how MASM lets you choose a mode, or cover how to detect what mode you're in using Assembly itself? Or we go into Data Representation & Number Systems (binary, hex, signed, unsigned, etc.)?

=================================

👀 Next up?
Let’s unlock the CPU modes — Real Mode, Protected Mode, Long Mode — what they are, how they affect your Assembly programming, and why MASM needs to know which one you're targeting.

Wanna go there now?
