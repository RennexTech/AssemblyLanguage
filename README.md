**🔧 My World of Assembly Language 🔧**

How to read? If you're full of energy read all the pdfs. It will take time, but you'll be a beast.

If you’re into reverse engineering / malware analysis:
You don’t read 100-page PDFs straight ❌

Hit a wall in x64dbg / Binary Ninja / IDA / Ghidra
→ Find the the exact notes on that topic that is blocking you
→ Find that section in the PDF
→ Read only what you need
→ Go back to the debugger
→ Apply it immediately

“What is LEA doing here?”
→ Search LEA x64 addressing
→ Read 2–3 pages
→ Step through the instruction live
→ See it click
→ Skill + knowledge lock in 🔒

Repeat loop:
Confusion → Targeted reading → Live application → Understanding → Muscle memory

That’s how reversers actually learn. Not by worshipping PDFs — by fighting binaries and stealing answers when stuck 😈 

That is active recall + contexual application = Skill Building on steroids!😤

Assembly programming Manual for the world....✨💖

That's good enough to give you the joy to dive in and learn assembly...

**⏱️ Pace Yourself**

Assembly is learning to speak to machines – it takes **time, REPETITION, REPETITION and patience**. 


**🕵️ Why Bother?**

To do a reverse engineer's job, malware analysis, pentesting and use tools like ghidra, ida, cutter, binary ninja, radare and the rest, that's where assembly shines. 

Plus, it's a great way to impress (or terrify) your programming buddies and your crush obviously.

I want you to be able to fine-tune any complex machine. 

It's not easy, but with time you'll get the flow. You'll be able to integrate it into your C/C++ programs.

You will be slapped by errors every single point, don't quit.

Also, many IDEs do not support assembly directly, so...

You'll learn to carry out research on the tools you need, go in yourself, download libaries, set them up manually and run them in your terminal or IDE. 

You are the compiler, you get the dependencies and set them up. 

Remember, I'm learning too! This is my attempt to make assembly a bit less scary for all of us curious coders out there.

**Tools I used:**

CherryTree for the old note-taking in 2022 🍒
Microsoft Word for reavamping/beautifying the notes in 2026📝
Time ⏳

**Let's rock the assembly world together! 🚀**
